# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a K16 Construction company website project. Currently contains only image assets for construction/renovation showcases including:
- Kitchen renovations
- Bathroom installations  
- Bedroom designs
- Home extensions
- British home styling

## Project Structure

```
K16 Construction/
├── images/           # Construction project showcase images
└── CLAUDE.md        # This file
```

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project without existing code:

1. **For static website development:**
   - Create index.html as the main entry point
   - Consider organizing styles in a css/ directory
   - Place JavaScript files in a js/ directory if needed

2. **For modern web app development:**
   - Initialize with appropriate framework (React, Vue, etc.)
   - Set up build tooling as needed
   - Configure deployment pipeline

## Image Assets

The images/ directory contains high-quality construction project photos that should be:
- Optimized for web delivery (consider compression)
- Used with appropriate alt text for accessibility
- Potentially organized into subcategories as the project grows

## Next Steps

When developing this site, consider:
- Creating a responsive design suitable for construction industry clients
- Implementing a gallery or portfolio section to showcase the existing images
- Adding contact forms for potential customers
- Including service descriptions and company information
